Hi, I'm Arun Pradeep from CSE department. I am currently pursuing third year of engineering in Panimadar Engineering College and recently I am working on a project which is a chatbot application. Whereas user can upload all kind of PDF Excel sheets and even the audio files like dot MP3 extension fields which is a MP3 files. So all these files can be uploaded by the user and most of the features are that implemented in this project are already inside GPT except the one feature which is getting the transcript from an audio file and asking question to that audio file. So the user can upload all kind of PDF Excel sheets and as well as the audio files and he can ask anything about it. So the main reason of why we need to why someone need to use the application is it reduces the time consumption. The user can ask any question to the PDF, upload a document and get a significant as well as the faster response from that particular PDF. Here the tech stack I used are React as a front end and for backend I go for Python which is REST API and fast API and and here also I used some of the APIs which is open source LLM such as GPT 2.0 and also for the transcription of an audio file here that I used Assembly AI to transcript the files. The user can access all kind of PDF content that he uploaded and ask any kind of questions based on the PDF and the LLM answer only to the particular question he asked if and only if the content was actually present in the PDF. This is the project I am working on and this is here I'm finished the introduction.
