Myself Arun Pradeep from CSE department. I am currently pursuing third year and I am working on one of an hackathon project which is the they will give a particular topic and the user need to talk about the topic for two minutes. And the two minute transcript will be stored in a particular file that I already mentioned where it need to be stored. And once the file was stored in the form of MP3 format, the MP3 format will be go to that call by using an API known as Assembly Assembly API which will use to give get the transcript of a particular MP3 file and once that file was completed, which means the once the transcript was completed, the user need to user can get access to that recordings as well as the transcript. So in that backend folder that I have created there are two files. One file is the MP3 file in which the audio recording of a user will be stored and the other file the file consists of the transcript of the file. And this is the base model for the prototype that I am working for. And once the transcript was done and dusted, by using an another API, maybe GPT 2.0 version, we can check whether how the user spoke in a particular region region, the sense how he spoke and in which math in which area he need to concentrate more. So likewise we can predict his moves. And this is the whole idea about the particular project.
