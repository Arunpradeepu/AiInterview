Hi guys, I am Arun Pradeep from CSE department and

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,680
I am going to talk about the challenge that I faced the first.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,600
Okay, not going to talk about the first challenge. The recent challenge that

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,760
I faced is working on a project to which is a

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,280
interview practice. I took on the

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,080
timer for two minutes and I can't stop the timer. I need to speak continuously

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,730
for those two minutes, you may ask. So it's not a any big,

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,970
big issue. But the issue is the API key is not working properly.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,330
So every time just talking two, two time, two minutes

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,210
continuously. And at the end it the message,

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,090
the content that I told are recorded for two minutes is there,

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,490
but it's not actually fetched by the API. So this

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,370
is the problem I am I actually faced. And that's

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,250
what I'm that's what the problem that is faced in recent times.
