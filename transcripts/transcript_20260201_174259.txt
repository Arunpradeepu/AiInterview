Good morning everyone. I am Arun Pradeep from CSE department. Currently pursuing third year of computer science engineering in Panimala Engineering College. And when it comes to handling the pressure, I am very good in it. Why? Because I don't actually think too much about the result. I used to think about the process I am working on. I used to think about that life is not about ending or the output. It's about the journey. So I just enjoy the process. And whatever they love to do, I will do. And this is how I handle the pressure. I don't care too much about the external pressure. And whenever I feel so pressure I just quit everything for a moment and think about what it would be if everything got solved. And this is how I actually do things.
