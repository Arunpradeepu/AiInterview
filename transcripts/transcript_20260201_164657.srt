Myself Arun Pradeep from CSE department. I am currently pursuing

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,960
third year and I am working on one

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,880
of an hackathon project which is the

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,720
they will give a particular topic and the user need to talk about

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,840
the topic for two minutes. And the two minute transcript will be stored

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,990
in a particular file that I already mentioned where it need to be stored.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,990
And once the file was stored in the form of MP3 format,

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,390
the MP3 format will be go

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,230
to that call by using an API known as Assembly Assembly

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,590
API which will use to give get the transcript of a particular MP3

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,750
file and once that file was completed,

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,800
which means the once the transcript was completed, the user

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,080
need to user can get

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,200
access to that recordings as well as

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,480
the transcript. So in that backend folder that I have created there

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,680
are two files. One file is the MP3 file

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,480
in which the audio recording of a user will

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,600
be stored and the other file the file consists of the transcript of the

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,660
file. And this is the base model for the prototype that I am working

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,100
for. And once the transcript was done and dusted,

21
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,820
by using an another API, maybe GPT

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,500
2.0 version, we can check

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,100
whether how the user spoke in a particular

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,020
region region, the sense how he spoke and in

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,260
which math in which area he need to concentrate more. So likewise we

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,220
can predict his moves. And this is

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,540
the whole idea about the particular project.
