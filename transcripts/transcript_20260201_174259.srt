Good morning everyone. I am Arun Pradeep from CSE department. Currently pursuing

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,600
third year of computer science engineering in Panimala Engineering College.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,200
And when it comes to handling the pressure, I am

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
very good in it. Why? Because I don't actually think too much

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,760
about the result. I used to think about the process I am working on.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,520
I used to think about that

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
life is not about ending or the output.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,840
It's about the journey. So I just enjoy the process.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,040
And whatever they love to do, I will do. And this

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,000
is how I handle the pressure. I don't care too much about the external

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,920
pressure. And whenever I feel

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,320
so pressure I just quit

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,840
everything for a moment and think about what it would be if

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,240
everything got solved. And this is how I actually do things.
