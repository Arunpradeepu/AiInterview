Hi, I'm Arun Pradeep from CSE department. I am

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,120
currently pursuing third year of engineering in Panimadar Engineering College and

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,120
recently I am working on a project which is a chatbot application.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,280
Whereas user can upload all kind of PDF Excel sheets

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,480
and even the audio files like dot MP3 extension

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,280
fields which is a MP3 files. So all these files can be

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,950
uploaded by the user and most of the

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,030
features are that implemented in this project are already

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,230
inside GPT except the one feature which is getting the

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,910
transcript from an audio file and asking question to that audio file.

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,950
So the user can upload all kind of PDF Excel sheets and as

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,750
well as the audio files and he can ask anything about it.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,230
So the main reason of why we need to why someone need to

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,030
use the application is it reduces the time consumption.

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,630
The user can ask any question to the PDF,

16
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,670
upload a document and get a significant as well as the

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,870
faster response from that particular PDF.

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,030
Here the tech stack I used are React as a front end and for backend

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,710
I go for Python which is REST API and fast API

20
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,280
and and here also I used some of the APIs

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,960
which is open source LLM such as GPT 2.0

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
and also for the transcription of an audio file here that I used

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,640
Assembly AI to transcript the files. The user

24
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,880
can access all kind of PDF content that he uploaded

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,760
and ask any kind of questions based on the PDF and the LLM

26
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,950
answer only to the particular question he asked if and only if the

27
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,910
content was actually present in the PDF. This is the project I am working

28
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,710
on and this is here I'm finished the introduction.
